Assignment 5

Create a web app for an online bookstore. For each book, we want to store the following
information:
• Title
• Author
• Publisher
• ISBN
• Classification/Category
• Price
All fields are required. Use the “Model First” approach described in the videos to set up and
create the database that we will use for the app. The ISBN needs to be entered in a valid format.
Include a “BookId” field that can be used as a primary key. Use good normalization principles
(i.e. no non-atomic fields, no repeating groups).
Seed the database using some of Prof. Hilton’s favorite books he’s read over the last few years
(found in the table on the next page).
Once the database has been created, list out all the books from the database on the Index view.
Be sure to style your page using Bootstrap (#notcovered in the videos, but there is a section at
the end of Chapter 7 in the Freeman textbook that goes over some styling techniques.)*@
